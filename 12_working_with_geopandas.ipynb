    "- [Shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html) for geometric operations (i.e. buffer, intersections etc.)\n",
    "- [PyProj](https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/index.html) for working with projections\n",
    "- [Fiona](https://pypi.org/project/Fiona/) for file input and output, which itself is based on the widely used [GDAL/OGR](https://gdal.org/) library\n",

    "We will carry out a geoprocessing task that shows various features of this library and show how to do geo data processing in Python. The task is to take a roads data layer from OpenStreetMap and compute the total length of National Highways for each district in a state. The problem is described in detail in my [Advanced QGIS](https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/advanced-qgis.html#exercise-find-the-length-of-national-highways-in-a-state) course and show the steps needed to perform this analysis in QGIS.
